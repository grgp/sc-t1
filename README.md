## 1st Project for Artificial Intelligence (Sistem Cerdas) class
#### sc-t1

1st module is a search problem in 2D grid space.
2nd module is a Sudoku solver, using the findings from Lynce and Ouaknine's paper (SudokuAsSAT.pdf).

This was a rather old project so I might have forgot a few of the details.
